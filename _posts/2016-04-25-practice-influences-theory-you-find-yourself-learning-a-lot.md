Practice influences theory; you find yourself learning a lot because you
yourself are becoming a part of the writing. In terms of the capabilities of colours and how colour
can effect our visual vocabulary, in misleading and responsive ways, I found what I learnt fascinating. Fundamentally, this book is about teaching and demonstrating colour as it's actual thing, not to be assigned a certain art field; colour for colours sake. 

"What counts here--- first and last --- is not so-called knowledge of so-calledfacts, but vision --- seeing. Seeing here implies Schauen (as in Weltanschauung) and is coupled with fantasy, with imagination." (ALBERS: 1963: 2) 

Do you create? Or instead think about how to change your vision to verbalise a theory. Don't forget, you need to concentrate on the art of seeing; create, see, imagine and enhance. This is the advice and the steps that these simple sentences create.

I find so many people dumbing there approaches and work down with solely their knowledge on the facts and theory and I have seen the repercussions of that in the work produced there from. Artists start work and explain their initial idea with such light and grandeur schemes, then it comes to finally seeing the end product and after concentrating so much on theoretically getting their approaches across they forget the vision they once had when they started. All your left with then, is a piece of fact, aesthetically suffered, imagination lost. 

Being brought up in the typical school system, what Albers' writings teach us are things about colour that we were not brought up to know; or at least I wasn't anyway.
